## Installation
### Prerequisites
First, you need to install the following for the Webgme project to work:
- git using homebrew
  ```
  brew install git

  ```
- [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/en/) (LTS recommended)
- [Python](https://www.python.org/)

- MongoDB. Pull the mongodb image in docker desktop and make a new container fro.
  - Steps to create a new container from the image:
    - Click the run button beside the mongo image and set the optional settings

Give a name to your container. I gave it sanjanadb.
Set host path as :

```
/Users/yourname/DB
```
Where DB is a folder I created to store all the database contents.
â€‹Set the Container path as

```
/data/db
```
