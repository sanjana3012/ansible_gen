# The Chameleon Cloud private network we have created has subnet 172.16.x.y. So we are
# referring to all the VMs that are going to be created here with this regexp. Naturally, we are not
# creating all these VMs and hence when we use this pattern, in order not to try visiting
# every IP address here, some of which will not be pointing to any VM, we use a conditional
# in our playbooks where we visit the node if and only if the current "ansible_host" is in
# a list of IP addresses that we have saved in a hostvars variable.
