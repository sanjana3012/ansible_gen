(1) IP addresses of bastion, masters and workers change; accordingly
~/.ssh/config needs to get updated. Any prior ~/.ssh/known_hosts file needs to
be either deleted OR the ssh-keygen with the -R option needs to be run so that
cached entries are cleared

(2) *_vars file has several params that may need to be updated. We might need
to have a template and then generate such a file based on what we need

(3) A template for Inventory directory will be needed and then this gets filled
as the ansible scripts start executing.

(4) config.toml file needs some common changes and some changes like priv
registry

(5) Which packages need to be installed on VMs need to be passed as a list
param

(6) Versions of docker, k8s etc keep changing and their installation steps
slightly modified periodically. So, our child playbooks need to be updated
every now and then.

(7) There is a need to identify ubuntu version, machine arch

(8) Note that all playbooks currently are geared toward Ubuntu based
installation. 

(9) Our chameleon vars file is tightly coupled to specific ubuntu version and
architecture. What if we had heterogeneous set of machines?

(10) Firewall rules may also differ. currently we have all the needed rules in
one child playbook. It is possible to build a loop and pass a bunch of ports

(11) When I tried to reuse the apparatus to mimic the 4 VM assignment scenario,
I was locked into the cluster/master/worker logic. I had only one cluster and
zero masters. So some scripts that save priv IP addresses etc got messed
up. The naming also messed up.
