# CS/ECE 4383/5383: Computer Networks
# Author: Aniruddha Gokhale
# Created: Fall 2023 based on similar playbooks created before.
#
# This playbook will create VMs as specified on the desired cloud platform
# See https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/collections/openstack/cloud/server_module.html
#
# Despite the numerous amount of commonality, to save time, I am repeating the steps
# for the Bastion, K8s masters, and K8s workers
