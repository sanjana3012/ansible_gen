Before running the playbook, you must define the local_user variable and
the cloud dictionary variables.

The local_user is the username on the laptop VM, e.g., vagrant
The cloud variable is a dictionary defined in a variables file, e.g.,
the supplied horizons_var.yml and chameleon_vars.yml files.

Run the master as like this:

ansible-playbook -e "local_user=vagrant" -e "@horizon_vars.yml" playbook_master.yml


OR

ansible-playbook -i Inventory -e "local_user=gokhale" -e "@chameleon_vars.yml" playbook_master.yml

You can also provide a -i <inventory> option
